## Mark Everingham, 1973--2012

This site is in tribute to Mark Everingham, a wonderful partner, son and
colleague, whom we lost far too early.  Mark gave so much to the computer
vision community, selflessly and always to such a high standard.  His
contributions will continue to benefit researchers for generations to come.
