## Joining the BMVA

You can now join the BMVA via [Registration page](https://bmva.charitysuite.com/events/dwonyclg):


If you are joining to attend a technical meeting then please note that the
non-member technical meeting cost includes a year's free membership to the
BMVA and will save you having to fill in a separate form.
