## Call for Presentations

We aim to bring together a diverse range of researchers and engineers in 3D Vision across all career stages. This event is a great opportunity to learn and network – even if you are new to the field! If you still need convincing, lunch is included.

We invite both academic and industry presentations 

**Presentations can be either published work, or ongoing research**. We are looking for both re-search and applied topics on quality assessment in areas similar to below (non-exhaustive list) 
*	

If you are unsure about the suitable of your topic, please contact the chairs.

Presentations will take the form of one of two types: poster, talk. When applying for a presentation, you are welcome to choose any combination of the options. You can apply to give a presentation using the form below.  Note that this will NOT be a hybrid event, therefore we expect **presenters to attend the event in person**.

**The deadline for submitting a presentation is the 27th November**
