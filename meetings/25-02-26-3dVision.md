## Overview of the Meeting

We are bringing together a diverse range of researchers and engineers in 3D Vision, across all career stages. This event is a great opportunity to learn and network – even if you are new to the field! If you still need convincing, lunch is included.

**Presentations will be either published work, or ongoing research**, in areas similar to below

* 3D from X
* 3D shape modelling and processing
* Applications of 3D Vision in film, television, and games
* Computational photography and photogrammetry
* RGB-D sensors and analytics
* Scene analysis and understanding
* Segmentation, grouping, and shape analysis
* 3D vision and graphics
* 3D acquisition
* 4D dynamic shapes
* Human-related 3D (face, gestures, pose, and body movement)
* Generative and morphable models
* 3D motion modelling
* Inverse rendering
