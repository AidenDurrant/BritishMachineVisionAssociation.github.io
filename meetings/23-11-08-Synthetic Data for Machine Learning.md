## Programme

The recent success of Machine Learning (ML) models is associated with the ability to train deep models on large-scale training data. However, annotating large-scale datasets is still the bottleneck in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) fields. Furthermore, ensuring diverse training data under challenging attributes like adverse weather conditions or when data is scarce is not only dangerous, time-consuming, and hard to collect but also cumbersome and subjective to human errors in the annotation process.
Synthetic data comes as a solution to help solve all the above issues. While its application in CV and NLP has attracted more attention, especially with the recent paradigm shift from model-centric ML to data-centric ML solutions. This Symposium explores all stages of synthetic data from its creation to use in training and as applications.
