## Invited Speakers

* Professor Sean Gong FREng, Queen Mary University of London
 
* Ashkan Khakzar, University of Oxford
 
* Oleg Sinavski, Principal Applied Scientist at Wayve, London



## Call for Presentations

We invite academic and industry presentations, bringing together researchers interested in all aspects of foundational models (GPT-4, CLIP, SAM, etc) and multimodal learning involving, but not limited to, image, video, audio, depth, text, drawings, laser, IMU, etc. 

**Presentations can be either published work or ongoing research**. The aim is to spotlight recent work, receive feedback and spur discussion. We expect presentations to cover one or more of the following areas (but this is a non-exhaustive list):

*   Multimodal data generation
*   Multimodal data preprocessing
*   Multimodal data fusion
*   Self-supervised learning for multimodal data
*   Unsupervised learning on multimodal data
*   Cross-modal adaptation
*   Multimodal transfer learning
*   Multimodal zero-shot learning with foundation models
*   Biases in foundation models/multimodal learning
*   Explainable multimodal learning
*	Trustworthy multimodal learning
*	Responsible multimodal learning
*	Applications of Multimodal learning (e.g. healthcare, robotics, social media)


Presentations will take the form of one of two types: poster, talk. When applying for a presentation, you are welcome to choose any combination of the options. You can apply to give a presentation using the form below.  Note that this will NOT be a hybrid event, therefore we expect **presenters to attend the event in person**.

**The deadline for submitting a presentation is the 21st Feburary 2024.**
