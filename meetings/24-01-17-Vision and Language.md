## Call for Presentations

We invite presentations from both academia and industry, bringing together researchers interested in all aspects of vision-language models and their potential future applications. 

**Presentations can be either published work or ongoing research**. The aim is to spotlight recent work, receive feedback and spur discussion. We expect presentations to cover one or more of the following areas (but this is a non-exhaustive list):

* What’s next for Vision-Language Models?
* Generative models (both text and vision generation)
* Retrieval and Search Based-Tasks
* Visual Question Answering
* Foundation Models
* Is Large-Scale Pre-training Required?
* Evaluating Generative Vision-Language Models
* Vision Language Benchmarks and Datasets
* Adversarial Attacks
* Security and Wellbeing

Presentations will take the form of one of three types: poster, talk, demo. When applying for a presentation, you are welcome to choose any combination of the options. You can apply to give a presentation using the form below.  Note that this will NOT be a hybrid event, therefore we expect **presenters to attend the event in person**.

**The deadline for submitting a presentation is the 27th November 2023.**
