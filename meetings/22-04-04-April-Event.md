We are looking forward to the BMVA 3 Day Symposium and hope to see you there! As we all know, it has been a challenging time for organising research events, and we hope that this in-person meeting will be a welcome opportunity for everyone to meet up and discuss research. As the circumstances are unusual, please make sure you read the following:

- **Included:** Registration is for in-person access to the event (there will be no hybrid or online attendance options); included are the event reception, lunch on all days, dinner on Monday and Tuesday. **Accommodation and travel are not included.** The website provides recommendations for affordable hotel accommodation, with easy access to the event hotel below.
- **Invited Keynotes:**: We have invited keynote speakers from recently appointed BMVA Distinguished Fellows, including [Phil Torr](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg/).
- **Missing Orals:** Many researchers missed out on presenting interesting work in person due to the need for virtual conferences. We will organise sessions to allow researchers who received an oral presentation at one of the conferences that became virtual during the pandemic to apply to give their presentation. Please select this option during registration.
**Poster Presentations:** We encourage all attendees to present a poster at the event; no formal proceedings will be published. Therefore attendees are free to choose whether they would like to present previous work (e.g. already published), current work in progress, or just new ideas that they wish to discuss or receive feedback on. Please indicate your interest in this on the registration form.
- **Refunds:** In the (hopefully unlikely) event that we cannot go ahead with the event, we will be offering refunds on registrations. There will be no online equivalent if the event cannot be held in person and all registrations refunded. 
- **Demos:**  We are also canvassing demand for demos and can provide a table and standard power for a demo presentation held conjointly with the posters.
- **Presentation Deadlines:** The deadline for poster and oral presentations registrations is 28th March

### Presentation details

#### Oral Presentations
The oral presentations are expected to be 15 minutes long, followed by 5 minutes of questions. Our AV team at the event will have a windows based computer to present via Powerpoint. Alternatively, you are welcome to use your device to connect via an HDMI port. After the oral presentation deadline of 28th March, a complete programme will be created with the time slots.

#### Poster Presentations 
The posters will be kept up for an entire day, and several poster sessions will occur throughout the day. Each poster presentation will have a single poster board, 2.1m high and 1.2m wide. They should just fit A0 in either portrait or landscape form,we wish to encourage attendees not to waste time reformatting posters and welcome portrait and landscape designs if already created for a previous conference.

#### Demo Presentations
Each demo request receives a 6ft trestle table and is situated close to some standard 13A British plug sockets. The demos will be co-located with the poster presentations and co-occur.
