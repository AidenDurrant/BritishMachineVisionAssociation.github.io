## Invited Speakers

* [Mathias Wien](https://www.lfb.rwth-aachen.de/en/institute/team/wien/) (RWTH Aachen University)

* [Andy Collins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-collins-bba8b0/) (Head of Video Quality Analysis at Prime Video)



## Call for Presentations

We aim to bring together a diverse range of researchers and engineers in Image and Video Quality across all career stages. This event is a great opportunity to learn and network – even if you are new to the field! If you still need convincing, lunch is included.

We invite both academic and industry presentations on the quality assessment of imaging systems (images, videos, medical imaging, graphics, virtual reality etc). This is a forum to showcase your work, receive feedback, practice your presentation skills, and spur discussion.

**Presentations can be either published work, or ongoing research**. We are looking for both research and applied topics on quality assessment in areas similar to below (non-exhaustive list) 
*	Classical / Deep Quality Models
*	Perceptual Quality / Psychophysics
*	Quality of Experience
*	Immersion
*	Medical Imaging
*	Computer Graphics
*	Compression
*	Robotics
*	Complexity Reduction
*	Robustness
*	New Datasets
*	Literature Reviews
*	Generative AI
*	Computational Imaging
*	Non-Visible Band Sensors: Infrared, Hy-perspectral, SAR etc.
*	Novel Imaging Systems: Event Camer-as, Lightfield, Virtual Reality etc. 

If you are unsure about the suitable of your topic, please contact the chairs.

Presentations will take the form of one of two types: poster, talk. When applying for a presentation, you are welcome to choose any combination of the options. You can apply to give a presentation using the form below.  Note that this will NOT be a hybrid event, therefore we expect **presenters to attend the event in person**.

**The deadline for submitting a presentation is the 8th October**
