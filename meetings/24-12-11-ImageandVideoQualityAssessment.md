## Call for Presentations

We aim to bring together a diverse range of researchers and engineers in Image and Video Quali-ty across all career stages. This event is a great opportunity to learn and network – even if you are new to the field! If you still need convincing, lunch is included.

We invite both academic and industry presentations on the quality assessment of imaging sys-tems (images, videos, medical imaging, graphics, virtual reality etc). This is a forum to showcase your work, receive feedback, practice your presentation skills, and spur discussion.

**Presentations can be either published work, or ongoing research**. We are looking for both re-search and applied topics on quality assessment in areas similar to below (non-exhaustive list) 
*	Classical / Deep Quality Models
*	Perceptual Quality / Psychophysics
*	Quality of Experience
*	Immersion
*	Medical Imaging
*	Computer Graphics
*	Compression
*	Robotics
*	Complexity Reduction
*	Robustness
*	New Datasets
*	Literature Reviews
*	Generative AI
*	Computational Imaging
*	Non-Visible Band Sensors: Infrared, Hy-perspectral, SAR etc.
*	Novel Imaging Systems: Event Camer-as, Lightfield, Virtual Reality etc. 

If you are unsure about the suitable of your topic, please contact the chairs.

Presentations will take the form of one of two types: poster, talk. When applying for a presentation, you are welcome to choose any combination of the options. You can apply to give a presentation using the form below.  Note that this will NOT be a hybrid event, therefore we expect **presenters to attend the event in person**.

**The deadline for submitting a presentation is the 8th October**
