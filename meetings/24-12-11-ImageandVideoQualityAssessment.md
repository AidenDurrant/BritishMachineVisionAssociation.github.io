## Overview of the Meeting

We are bringing together a diverse range of researchers and engineers in Image and Video Quality across all career stages. This event is a great opportunity to learn and network – even if you are new to the field! If you still need convincing, lunch is included.

**Presentations will be either published work, or ongoing research**, in areas similar to below
*	Classical / Deep Quality Models
*	Perceptual Quality / Psychophysics
*	Quality of Experience
*	Immersion
*	Medical Imaging
*	Computer Graphics
*	Compression
*	Robotics
*	Complexity Reduction
*	Robustness
*	New Datasets
*	Literature Reviews
*	Generative AI
*	Computational Imaging
*	Non-Visible Band Sensors: Infrared, Hyperspectral, SAR etc.
*	Novel Imaging Systems: Event Cameras, Lightfield, Virtual Reality etc.
