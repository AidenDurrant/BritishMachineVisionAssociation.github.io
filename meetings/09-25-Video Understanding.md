## Call for Posters:

New models for video understanding remain a bottleneck for research despite the increase in the number of large-scale video datasets. To have a day to exchange ideas, establish tight collaborations and recommend new research directions, we, the organisers, are planning for the BMVA symposium on Video Understanding to be held in Central London, at the British Computer Society on Wednesday 25th of September 2019. 
The symposium’s objective is to share the latest research, but also feedback to the community about the major challenges, and plan for an ongoing collaboration on video understanding beyond the simplified concept of classification of trimmed videos. 
The symposium is a full-day event with invited speakers and a poster presentation session. The event will bring together 150 students, faculty, and research scientists for an opportunity to exchange ideas and connect over a mutual interest in video understanding
