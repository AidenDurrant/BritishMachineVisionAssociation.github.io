## Call for Papers

Humans have an outstanding ability to navigate and understand complex environments using vision, albeit with varying degrees of performance. Visual data is hugely rich in semantic cues regarding where an observer is and where she should go next in order to complete a task. It is therefore not surprising that localisation and spatial awareness is an increasingly active area of research within computer vision and robotics, targeting a multitude of applications such as self-driving vehicles, autonomous drones, and location-aware augmented reality.

Autonomous localisation and spatial awareness using vision is challenging, particularly when other sensors, such as a global positioning system (GPS), are unreliable or not available. Semantic cues are numerous and often ambiguous, and the data is inherently noisy and corrupted, with dynamic objects and environment conditions such as weather and time of day, impacting significantly on reliable inference. Commercial potential also brings with it hard practical constraints such as a need for trust and reliability, especially relevant in the context of self-driving vehicles, and real-time performance.

Commercial potential, coupled with advances in learning, 3-D vision and the ever-increasing computational power of autonomous systems, is driving forward advances in this area. Within this context, the aim of this meeting is to bring together researchers and practitioners from industry and academia, interested in all aspects of localization and spatial awareness and potential future applications. Contributions in the form of talks and posters are invited in relevant areas, including, but not limited to:

- Autonomous driving. 
- Navigation and localization systems.
- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
- Robotic navigation.
- Localization algorithms.
- Vision as a navigation aid.
- Data fusion for Localisation
- Novel on-vehicle sensing.
- Change detection based on Localisation.
- Position estimation.

Other topics within the broadly applicable domain of localization and spatial awareness will also be considered for inclusion.

## Submission Deadline
