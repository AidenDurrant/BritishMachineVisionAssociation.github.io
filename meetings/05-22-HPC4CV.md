## Programme

The last decades have witnessed amazing progress in the field of Computer Vision, where state-of-art methodologies provide astonishing performance. At the root of this growth is the conjunction between advances in computer architecture and availability of large amounts of data, that have triggered new lines of research while shedding renewed light on classical Computer Vision tasks, considered intractable from a practical standpoint until a few years ago. New high-performance computing platforms and paradigms (many-core processors, FPGA accelerators, large-scale clusters, cloud computing) is gaining momentum and becoming mainstream.
The interplay between algorithms/methods for Computer Vision and high-performance computing architecture/programming thus continues to provide interesting challenges to researchers in the field.  The goal of this one-day meeting is to provide a view on trends and issues in the use of modern high-performance and large-scale computing platforms for the challenges of Computer Vision.
