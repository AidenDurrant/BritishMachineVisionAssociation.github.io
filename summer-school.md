The BMVA runs an annual summer school on computer vision. Speakers on the Summer School are academic researchers or experienced practitioners from industry. It has been running for since the 1990s and is updated every year to ensure it covers the state-of-the-art, broadens awareness of related research fields, and develops research skills.

The summer school also fulfills an important social function in that it gives attendees a chance to meet other vision students and researchers from around the UK and beyond.

### Call for Proposals to Host the 2024 Summer School!

The summer school is an excellent opportunity for computer vision researchers at the start of their careers and is a priority for the BMVA. This is only possible through the kind work of volunteers from the academic and industry communities who host and support the organisation of the school.
