The BMVA runs an annual summer school on computer vision. Speakers on the Summer School are academic researchers or experienced practitioners from industry. It has been running for since the 1990s and is updated every year to ensure it covers the state-of-the-art, broadens awareness of related research fields, and develops research skills.

The summer school also fulfills an important social function in that it gives attendees a chance to meet other vision students and researchers from around the UK and beyond.
