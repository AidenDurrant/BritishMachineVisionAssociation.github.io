## The Sullivan Doctoral Thesis Prize

The British Machine Vision Association has established a prize fund to
commemorate the contribution made by the late Professor Geoff Sullivan to the
advancement of the field of Computer Vision in the United Kingdom. The prize
is considered for award, on an annual basis, to the best doctoral thesis
submitted to a UK University, in the field of computer or natural vision.

Recommendations for the prize are considered by a Selection Panel appointed
annually by the BMVA Executive Committee.

The decision of the Selection Panel is announced at the annual
[British Machine Vision Conference]({{ site.baseurl }}/bmvc), at which the presentation will
be made.

### 2019 Prize Nominations

The BMVA Executive Committee seeks nominations for the Sullivan Prize
for theses examined during the calendar year 2018.  Internal examiners
and supervisors may act as nominators, but the committee would like to
receive an accompanying report and endorsement of the nomination from
the external examiner of the thesis. The closing date for theses to be
considered for the award of the 2019 prize is 31st May 2019.

### Overview

The Sullivan Thesis Prize celebrates early stage researchers working in the field of computer vision and related areas in the United Kingdom. The prize will be presented at the annual British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC)conference dinner. The prize fund is provided by the British Machine Vision Association (BMVA) to commemorate the contribution made by the late Professor Geoff Sullivan.

While normally awarded annually, in 2023 we have widened the eligibility criteria due to the impact of COVID-19. We want all applicable candidates to feel empowered to apply, so please feel free to contact the award organizers if you have any further questions, or are unsure about eligibility.

### Acceptance Criteria

We welcome submissions from anyone who has submitted their PhD thesis at a university in the United Kingdom between 1st April 2019 and 31st August 2023. Any topic that is applicable under the current BMVC call for papers is valid.

### Submission

Candidates should submit a short summary (max 500 words) providing an overview of the contributions made during their PhD, and a digital copy of their completed PhD Thesis. If available, it is recommended that the external examiner(s) report for the Thesis is also included, which can either be post-viva or post-corrections (preferred).

[Optional] Candidates may also provide additional supporting evidence, which may include but is not limited to:

- Up to 3 accepted paper(s) as first author (or equal contributor)
- Blog post(s)
- Conference poster(s)
- Details of External talks (e.g. conferences)
- Profile page(s) on Google Scholar, ResearchGate etc.
- Report from an industrial placement
- Endorsement from either an academic or industrial supervisor
- Demos

Please submit evidence in PDF format, or provide an accessible link. If any of the evidence is confidential please get permission before submitting.

Submissions should be made using CMT: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SullivanThesisPrize2023

**Submission deadline: 15 September 2023**

### Award process

After the submission deadline, each application will be assessed by a panel of experts from academia and industry. Applications will be marked across a broad range of criteria including originality, academic/industrial impact, breadth and depth.
