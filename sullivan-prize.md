title: The Sullivan Doctoral Thesis Prize
---

## The Sullivan Doctoral Thesis Prize

The British Machine Vision Association has established a prize fund to
commemorate the contribution made by the late Professor Geoff Sullivan to the
advancement of the field of Computer Vision in the United Kingdom. The prize
is considered for award, on an annual basis, to the best doctoral thesis
submitted to a UK University, in the field of computer or natural vision.

Recommendations for the prize are considered by a Selection Panel appointed
annually by the BMVA Executive Committee.

The decision of the Selection Panel is announced at the annual
[British Machine Vision Conference]({{ site.baseurl }}/bmvc/), at which the presentation will
be made.

### 2019 Prize Nominations

The BMVA Executive Committee seeks nominations for the Sullivan Prize
for theses examined during the calendar year 2018.  Internal examiners
and supervisors may act as nominators, but the committee would like to
receive an accompanying report and endorsement of the nomination from
the external examiner of the thesis. The closing date for theses to be
considered for the award of the 2019 prize is 31st May 2019.

### Regulations

+ The prize of £750 is considered for presentation annually for the best
doctoral thesis.

+ Submissions must be in the broad areas of computer vision, including
computational studies of natural vision.

+ The submission period is by calendar year.

+  Valid submission dates are based on the date of the successful viva voce
exam, as evidenced by the signed examiners' reports.

+ Submissions must be in electronic form. The thesis must first be submitted
  into the [thesis archive]({{ site.baseurl }}/thesis-archive/). Other submission materials
